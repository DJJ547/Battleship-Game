Participants: JiaJun Dai, Taeho Lee, Kevin Lopez, Nikola Klier

This is a strategy type guessing game between the player and AI. After the player and AI finish setting up positions for their ships, they take turns to fire shots on each other's sea map. Once a shot from one side htis, that side gets to fire next shot consecutively. The winner will be the one who destroys every ship in his opponentâ€™s grid. 

This program uses MVC pattern and valve control.

Size of player grid: 10 x 10

Number of ships each side has:
1. one aircraft carrier (length 5)
2. one cruiser (length 4)
3. two destroyer (length 3)
4. one submarine (length 2)
