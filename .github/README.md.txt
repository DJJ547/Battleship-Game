This is a strategy type guessing game between the player and AI. After the player and AI finish setting up positions for their ships, they take turns to fire shots on each other's sea map. Once a shot from one side is hit, this side continues to fire another shot until he misses. Each type of ship has its own ability/skill that can only be used once before the ship is completely destroyed. The winner will be the one who destroys every ship in his opponentâ€™s sea map. more detail please check the README file.
